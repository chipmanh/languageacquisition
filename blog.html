    <p>I thought the language acquisition in children learning their native language was interesting, as I have a three month old nephew and have gotten to view firsthand his language development since he was born. He recently started smiling and laughing, and "talks" back to us when we talk to him. It is interesting to see him go through each stage, from crying to cooing and now some babbling. I did not realize there was process to this development and I am excited to see him develop his language skills even further!</p> 
    <p> I was surprised to learn there are world-wide readiness standards for languages, as I thought standards for language learning would be determined by schools themselves. The issue of providing national standards for teaching and learning beyond standardized tests is an issue in the US education system, and I am impressed that the world readiness standard for learning languages provides that for teachers and students.</p>
