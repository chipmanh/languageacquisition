<p> I liked the comprehensible input hypothesis because it reminds me of a key concept in computer science. The comprehensible input hypothesis states that language is acquired through i + 1, with the i representing current language level and the + 1 representing for languahe beyond that level. i + 1 is used so often in programming that there was even a shortcut made for it (++), and a language named after it (C++). I like the idea of constantly learning more and going beyond what you already know. </p>
