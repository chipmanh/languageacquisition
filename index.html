<h1>Language Acquisition and Pedagogy</h1>
<button type="button"> Blog </button>
<p>I thought the language acquisition in children learning their native language was interesting, as I have a three month old nephew and have gotten to view firsthand his language development since he was born. He recently started smiling and laughing, and is "talks" back to us when we talk to him. It is interesting to see him go through each stage, from crying to cooing and now some babbling. I did not realize there was process to this development and I am excited to see him develop his language skills even further!</p>
