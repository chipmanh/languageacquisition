      <b>Topic:</b> sports, exercises <br>
       <b>Tools:</b> powerpoint, whiteboard <br>
        <b> Activites: </b> debate pros/cons of an exercise/sport <br> 
        <br>
        The class was conversational and the students seemed to really enjoy the debate activity, which became very competitive. The professor acted out the sports/exercise vocabulary physically to show the meaning of the words along with an introductory powerpoint. The powerpoint provided an introduction into the new vocabulary and sentence strucutres of that lesson. After going through the powerpoint the students were assigned to groups and instructions were given in English to come up with a sport to reccomend and the pros/cons of each sport. During the debate the professor asked questions to clarify student meaning and facilitated the heated conversations. Total physical response was used when students were explaining their sport/exercise. The debate allowed the students to use the new vocabulary in sentences as well as use old vocabulary in different ways.
